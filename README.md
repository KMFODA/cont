  - `btcli s register --wallet.name <> --wallet.hotkey <> --subtensor.network test --netuid 212`

# Step 4.
  - Run your miner.
  - `python3 miner.py --wallet.name <> --wallet.hotkey <> --subtensor.network test --netuid 212 --bucket <Bucket> --device <>`

# Step 5.
  - Run your validator.
  - `python3 validator.py --wallet.name <> --wallet.hotkey <> --subtensor.network test --netuid 212 --bucket <Bucket> --device <>`
